    // Basic setup
    //

    //The App
    var app = new PIXI.Application({
        width:640,
        height:480,
        backgroundColor: 0x000000
    });
    var stage = app.stage;
    var view = app.view;

    //Add view to the document
    document.body.appendChild(app.view);

    /*
        Depending on the system or context, these can be called "scenes" "views" "pages" "panels" or all sorts of other things.

        The important bit is that they are each a grouping or state of different interface elements that need to be on the screen at different times.

        We'll call them "scenes" – if only because they're going up onto the Pixi.js stage object when we need them.
    */

    //
    // Let's create a few really boring scenes using Pixi.js Containers
    //

    

    //SCENE 1
let scene1 = new PIXI.Container();

//Using our button object let's create a "next" button.
let nextButton = UI.Button(0,0,"Next >");

//Let's place it in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen (regardless of size)
nextButton.x = app.view.width  - nextButton.width;
nextButton.y = app.view.height - nextButton.height;

//And place it into the scene
scene1.addChild(nextButton);

//And let's add some text to tell us which scene we're on
let scene1Text = new PIXI.Text("Scene 1",{fill:0xFFFFFF});

//And place it into the scene
scene1.addChild(scene1Text);

   //SCENE 2
   let scene2 = new PIXI.Container();

//Using our button object let's create a "next" button.
let backButton = UI.Button(0,0,"< Back");

//Let's place it in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen (regardless of size)
backButton.x = 0;
backButton.y = app.view.height - backButton.height;

//And place it into the scene
scene2.addChild(backButton);

//And let's also add some text to tell us which scene we're on
let scene2Text = new PIXI.Text("Scene 2",{fill:0xFFFFFF});

//And place it into the scene
scene2.addChild(scene2Text);


//Now let's add the first scene to the stage
app.stage.addChild(scene1);


    /*

        So now we have two scenes set up, and the first scene on stage.

        The easiest, ugliest way to swap between scenes, would be to assign some code to each button to pull the current scene off the stage and replace it with another.

        This week's homework!

        Accept the assignment invite for Meet The Fish (when it goes up).

        Put together a multi-scened presentation to show off fictional profiles of 3 of *your* fish. (Replace the ones in the images folder here.)

        (Read up on the Graphics and Text display objects here:)
        
            https://pixijs.download/dev/docs/PIXI.Graphics.html
            https://pixijs.download/dev/docs/PIXI.Text.html
        
        (They will help.)
        
        Each fish should be animated on their profile page in their own unique way.
        
        There should be – at least – a title screen, and one screen for each fish but bonus points for adding on more.

        Add to the button system so that the buttons look more aesthetic.

        Add in a new transition of your choice and implement it on one of your transitions.
