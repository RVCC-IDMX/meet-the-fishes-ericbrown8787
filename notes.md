### Fish 1:

Species(Common): Buoyant Aether Gulper

### Fish 2:

Species(Common): Plane-Hopping Singleton

Species(Binomial): Xenolepomis solitus

Description: A multiversal constant, only one individual of this species may be born in each timeline. A school of these fish is made up entirely of versions of the same individual, each one a refugee from a different doomed reality.

### Fish 3:

Species(Common): Abyssal Shrieker

Species(Binomial): Betta stridens

Description: This fish is cursed with knowledge of the invisible barrier that separates our world from its own. Vibrations in this barrier briefly attract the fish's attention, and with it, its rage.
